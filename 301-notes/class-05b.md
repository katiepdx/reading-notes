- Slow down
- Jigsaw puzzle - look at all the pieces, start form the border/edges and work from there. Build.

## The Surprising Power of Questions FROM https://hbr.org/2018/05/the-surprising-power-of-questions
Ask questions the other person will enjoy answering. People don't ask enough questions. 

Conversation: Two goals: Learning and impression management (liking). 

Asking a lot of questions helps learning and improves personal bonding. 

**The New Socratic Method**: 
Ask questions to get better at asking questions.

- Favor follow-up questions
- Know when to ask open-ended questions (avoid interrogating)
- Get the sentence right - in tense situations, ask tough questions first
    - When building relationships, start with less sensitive questions. 
- Pay attention to tone
    - People open up more when asked in a casual way
    - When given the option to change their answer, people tend to be more open with their answers. 
- Group dynamics

Conversations are like a dance. Privacy vs transparency. Think careful about how you handle answering tough questions. **Tough questions**: Eloquent and undetected question dodgers were favored over ineloquent answers. Deflecting or answering a question with another question or joke.
