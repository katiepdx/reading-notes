**Idea:**
Trip planner  

**Method**
Have a research page where you can search for info on a destination. On the other half of the page you have your create a tile form where you can add info as you research. This is stored to the database under the userId. It would be cool to add public tiles where others can see and comment! 


**APIs**
- REST Countries
- Weatherbit to search for weather by location
- Yelp 
- Flickr for location photos
