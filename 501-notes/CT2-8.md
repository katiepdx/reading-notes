## Composition vs Inheritance FROM https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html
- When reusing code between components, it is recommended to use the composition model. 
- **Containment**: 
  - Components that don't know their children, it's recommended to use `props.children` in to their output.
  - Other components can pass nested JSX to them

  ```js
  // EXAMPLE FROM SITE 

  // Fancy Border CHILD component
  function FancyBorder(props) {
  return (
    <div className={'FancyBorder FancyBorder-' + props.color}>
      // child component
      {props.children}
    </div>
  );
  }

  ```

  ```js
  // Other component that passes JSX to the FancyBorder component
  function WelcomeDialog() {
    return (
      <FancyBorder color="blue">
        // h1 to p tag -- this is passed as {props.children}
        <h1 className="Dialog-title">
          Welcome
        </h1>
        <p className="Dialog-message">
          Thank you for visiting our spacecraft!
        </p>
      </FancyBorder>
    );
  }
  ```

  - Can change the word used. Instead of props.children, you can use props.left or props.right, etc.
  - this is useful for adding multiple slots for inserting data.

- **Specialization**: 
  - two components having a special link to one another (e.g, WelcomeDialog and Dialog component)
  - "specific" component renders a "generic" component using props. 
    - pass props from WelcomeDialog. WelcomeDialog uses `<Dialog greeting="Good morning" name="Sam">`. The Dialog function component accepts props and has a place for `{props.greeting}` and `{props.name}`. 
  - works with functional and class components 

  - Props and composition allow for flexibility. You can customize the behavior and look for a component in a safe way.
